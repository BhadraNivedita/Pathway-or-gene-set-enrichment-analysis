# Pathway or gene set enrichment analysis


## Introduction
Pathway and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a powerful computational technique widely used in the field of genomics and bioinformatics. It helps researchers uncover the biological significance of large-scale gene expression or omics data by identifying which biological pathways or sets of genes are statistically overrepresented in a given dataset.

This GitHub repository houses a collection of tools, scripts, and resources that enable you to perform pathway/GSEA analysis efficiently. Whether you are a biologist, bioinformatician, or data scientist, this repository provides the resources you need to conduct meaningful pathway/GSEA analysis on your own data.

## What is Pathway/Gene Set Enrichment Analysis?
Pathway/Gene Set Enrichment Analysis is a statistical method used to interpret large-scale genomics or omics data by assessing whether predefined sets of genes (gene sets or pathways) are significantly enriched among differentially expressed or relevant genes. It helps researchers gain insights into the biological processes, functions, and pathways that are perturbed in their experiments.
