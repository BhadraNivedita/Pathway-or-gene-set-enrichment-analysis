# Pathway or gene set enrichment analysis


## Introduction
Pathway and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a powerful computational technique widely used in the field of genomics and bioinformatics. It helps researchers uncover the biological significance of large-scale gene expression or omics data by identifying which biological pathways or sets of genes are statistically overrepresented in a given dataset.

This GitHub repository houses a collection of tools, scripts, and resources that enable you to perform pathway/GSEA analysis efficiently. Whether you are a biologist, bioinformatician, or data scientist, this repository provides the resources you need to conduct meaningful pathway/GSEA analysis on your own data.

## What is Pathway/Gene Set Enrichment Analysis?
Pathway/Gene Set Enrichment Analysis is a statistical method used to interpret large-scale genomics or omics data by assessing whether predefined sets of genes (gene sets or pathways) are significantly enriched among differentially expressed or relevant genes. It helps researchers gain insights into the biological processes, functions, and pathways that are perturbed in their experiments. 

## Why Use Pathway/Gene Set Enrichment Analysis?
Pathway/GSEA analysis offers several advantages:

Biological Interpretation: It provides biological context to high-throughput data by identifying the underlying biological processes and pathways affected.

Reduced Multiple Testing: Instead of testing each gene individually, it tests gene sets, reducing the multiple testing burden and increasing statistical power.

Biologically Meaningful Results: It enables researchers to focus on biologically relevant results, making it easier to generate hypotheses and prioritize further investigations.
